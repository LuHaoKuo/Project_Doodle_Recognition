# Doodling with Deep Learning!

### This is the Repo of our Quick Draw Kaggel Competition Project.<br>
### We present our data preprocessing, models fittings, and a fun application of the Google Quick, Draw! dataset. This project  was built by Akhilesh Reddy, Vincent Kuo, Kirti Pande, Tiffany Sung, and Helena Shi. To see the full walk-through, find our blog post at: __blog__

#### Walk with us through this journey to see how we have tackled the challenge in successfully classifying what is “arguably the world’s cutest research dataset!”    

<br>
<br>

**Shuffle_CSV_and_ResNet** folder:  includes data pre-processing/shuffle csv code and the SE-ResNet model we tried.<br>

**Mobile_net** folder:  includes the Mobile Net model code and training.<br>

**OtherModels** folder: we tried some skicit learn classifiers for instance Random Forest, k-NN and MLP Classifier.<br>

**QuickDraw** folder: One can replicate the application we created by running the QuickDrawApp.py code. Also, download the CNN model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PAFXI5HrY7HguZy0I8yDaUQUebTQYus0 and save in the same location as the folder.<br>

The model is trained for 15 classes:
<br>Donut 🍩 <br>
Eye 👁<br>
Tent ⛺<br>
Bicycle 🚲<br>
Flower 🌸<br>
Mermaid 🧜‍<br>
Snake 🐍<br>
Camera 📷<br>
Pineapple 🍍<br>
Rainbow 🌈<br>
Lipstick 💄<br>
Face 😊<br>
Shoe 👠 <br>
Cup ☕<br>
Hockey stick 🏑 <br>

A preview of the application is as follows:
